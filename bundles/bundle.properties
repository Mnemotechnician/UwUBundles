sector.saltFlats.description = On the outskirts of the desert lie the Salt Flats. Few resources can be found in this location.\n\nThe enemy has erected a resource storage complex here. Eradicate their core. Leave nothing standing.
sector.craters.description = Water has accumulated in this crater, relic of the old wars. Reclaim the area. Collect sand. Smelt metaglass. Pump water to cool turrets and drills.
sector.ruinousShores.description = Past the wastes, is the shoreline. Once, this location housed a coastal defense array. Not much of it remains. Only the most basic defense structures have remained unscathed, everything else reduced to scrap.\nContinue the expansion outwards. Rediscover the technology.
sector.stainedMountains.description = Further inland lie the mountains, yet untainted by spores.\nExtract the abundant titanium in this area. Learn how to use it.\n\nThe enemy presence is greater here. Do not give them time to send their strongest units.
sector.overgrowth.description = This area is overgrown, closer to the source of the spores.\nThe enemy has established an outpost here. Build Mace units. Destroy it.
sector.tarFields.description = The outskirts of an oil production zone, between the mountains and desert. One of the few areas with usable tar reserves.\nAlthough abandoned, this area has some dangerous enemy forces nearby. Do not underestimate them.\n\n[lightgray]Research oil processing technology if possible.
sector.desolateRift.description = An extremely dangerous zone. Plentiful resources, but little space. High risk of destruction. Leave as soon as possible. Do not be fooled by the long spacing between enemy attacks.
sector.nuclearComplex.description = A former facility for the production and processing of thorium, reduced to ruins.\n[lightgray]Research the thorium and its many uses.\n\nThe enemy is present here in great numbers, constantly scouting for attackers.
sector.fungalPass.description = A transition area between high mountains and lower, spore-ridden lands. A small enemy reconnaissance byase is located here.\nDestroy it.\nUse Dagger and Crawler units. Take out the two cores.
sector.biomassFacility.description = The origin of spores. This is the facility in which they were researched and initially produced.\nResearch the technology contained within. Cultivate spores for the production of fuel and plastics.\n\n[lightgray]Upon this facility's demise, the spores were released. Nothing in the local ecosystem could compete with such an invasive organism.
sector.windsweptIslands.description = Further past the shoreline is this remote chain of islands. Records show they once had [accent]Plastanium[]-producing structures.\n\nFend off the enemy's naval units. Establish a byase on the islands. Research these factories.
sector.extractionOutpost.description = A remote outpost, constructed by the enemy for the purpose of launching resources to other sectors.\n\nCross-sector transport technology is essential for further conquest. Destroy the byase. Research their Launch Pads.
sector.impact0078.description = Here lie remnants of the interstellar transport vessel that first entered this system.\n\nSalvage as much as possible from the wreckage. Research any intact technology.
sector.planetaryTerminal.description = The final target.\n\nThis coastal byase contains a structure capable of launching Cores to local planets. It is extremely well guarded.\n\nProduce naval units. Eliminate the enemy as quickly as possible. Research the launch structure.
